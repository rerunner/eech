# EECH

Enemy Engaged â€“ Comanche vs. Hokum (EECH) is a combined forces realtime battlefield helicopter simulation.

This is not the latest main community mod code (v1.16.1), but a fork of the v1.15.0 version hosted on github. 

## Current status
This fork has now been been ported to compile and run with Visual Studio 2019!

## Preconditions
1) Install original game and fly it once.
2) Install community mod 1.15.0 (just copy to original install dir)
3) Install DirectX7 SDK 
4) Install Visual Studio 2019 (free version)

That's it.
